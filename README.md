====================

Experimenting with walking around an object in an Objective-C app

Please note, this is very rough, especially the gl32_learning branch.  My main goal with that
branch was to do whatever it took to get something displayed on the screen and then to clean
it up later.  That said, it does display something.  So it's probably not the worst place to
start.

I'll add more as I get time.
